# Tour of Salesforce REST APIs for Multiple DML in Single Request

In this session, I introduce you to three different Salesforce REST APIs designed specifically
to perform multiple DML to different objects and handle complex data structures in a single request.
See real code and live demos of **Apex REST Services**, **Composite API**, and **SObject Tree API**.
Avoid troublesome rollback scenarios and burning through API requests of traditional development
and learn to design efficient, robust integrations with the Salesforce REST API.
